## Error Logs and Error Codes
Error logs and error codes for many games are very important, especially those that don't connect to a server and and operate only on the client. Because they don't connect to a server (and even games that do), error logs and error codes are used to allow players to report errors to the developers, as the developers won't know when something goes wrong.
